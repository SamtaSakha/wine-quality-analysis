###🍷 Wine Quality Analysis – A Machine Learning Project
# 🔍 Project Overview
The Wine Quality Analysis project focuses on building a predictive model that can classify the quality of wines based on their physicochemical properties. The primary objective is to leverage data science and machine learning techniques to accurately estimate the quality rating of wine samples — a task that would typically require expert sensory evaluation, which is time-consuming and subjective.

By automating this process, wine manufacturers and distributors can achieve faster quality control, reduce human error, and ensure consistency in their production processes.

📌 Problem Statement
Wine quality is often judged based on sensory data by human tasters, making it highly subjective, inconsistent, and costly. This project aims to create a machine learning-based system that predicts the quality score of wine using measurable chemical attributes.

The model not only predicts the quality but also reveals which features most significantly affect it, offering valuable insights to winemakers and quality control experts.

🧾 Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is a combination of red and white wine samples. It consists of physicochemical test results, along with a quality score assigned by wine experts (range: 0–10). For simplification and better classification results, we grouped the quality scores into three categories:

Low Quality: 0–5

Medium Quality: 6

High Quality: 7–10

✅ Input Features (Physicochemical Tests)
Fixed Acidity

Volatile Acidity

Citric Acid

Residual Sugar

Chlorides

Free Sulfur Dioxide

Total Sulfur Dioxide

Density

pH

Sulphates

Alcohol

🎯 Target Feature
Quality: An integer score (0 to 10), later mapped to categorical classes for classification.

🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We began with data cleaning, checking for missing values, and verifying data types. Exploratory visualizations like histograms, box plots, and heatmaps were used to uncover patterns, correlations, and distributions.

Key Findings from EDA:
The dataset is imbalanced: majority of wines are rated as medium quality.

Alcohol content has a strong positive correlation with quality.

Volatile acidity shows a negative correlation with quality.

Sulphates, citric acid, and pH also contribute meaningfully.

🔁 Preprocessing
Before model training, we followed a standard preprocessing pipeline:

Missing values: Dropped for simplicity (could also be imputed).

Label Encoding: The target variable (quality) was simplified into 3 categories.

Feature Scaling: Standardization using StandardScaler ensured that all features contributed equally to the learning algorithm.

Train-Test Split: Data was split into 80% training and 20% testing sets.

🧠 Model Building
We used the Random Forest Classifier, a powerful ensemble learning technique that works well on tabular and high-dimensional data.

Model Highlights:
Automatically handles non-linearity and feature interactions

Provides built-in feature importance

Robust to outliers and overfitting with proper tuning

Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, F1-score (per class)

Results:
Good performance with minimal tuning

High precision for detecting medium and high-quality wines

Alcohol, sulphates, and acidity were top contributors

📊 Feature Importance Analysis
The top 5 features based on Random Forest importance:

Alcohol

Sulphates

Volatile Acidity

Citric Acid

Total Sulfur Dioxide

These insights can help winemakers control the chemical balance of wine for better quality.

🚀 Future Work
Implement hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV

Experiment with regression-based approach to predict the exact score

Use SMOTE or other techniques to balance the dataset

Build a web app or API for real-time wine quality prediction
